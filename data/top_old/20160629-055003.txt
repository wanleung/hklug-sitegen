Content:
**Congratulation!** It is our pleasure that the website of HKLUG is now blocked by the **GFW, China**, and the information on WIKI was removed by the **"Chinese"** because we are a **"new"** organisation and **not "well-known"** in **"China"**. HKLUG was founded at **1997 in Hong Kong**, which is aimed to gather GNU/Linux and Free/Opensource software(F/OSS) users or developers in Hong Kong, providing chances for them to exchange experience on GNU/Linux and F/OSS, helping new users, promoting F/OSS in Hong Kong and acting as a connection point of all the F/OSS users, developers and organization or community from overseas; in order to help the GNU/Linux and F/OSS Community. We are happy that we could receive this kind of nice present from our **good neighbour** to celebrate our **19th Anniversary**. Thanks China. Your present is a credit of our works and is the energy source of our actions to promote the **"Free(dom), and Open"** culture on not only programming but also living.
