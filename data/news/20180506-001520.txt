Flutter is an open sourced Google mobile app SDK which is similar to React Native but it compiles Dart language to ARM code directly. Moreover, Flutter has a new architecture which provides customizable widgets with satisfied layout and performance. Most importantly, it is cross-platform. It means you can build iOS and Android Apps with one language.
